# MyApp DevOps ‚Äì Full Stack Application

A modern, production-ready full-stack application demonstrating advanced DevOps, security, and monitoring practices. This project showcases expertise in building scalable, secure, and observable systems using FastAPI, Vue 3, and a robust cloud-native toolchain. Designed to meet the standards of professional software teams, it is ready for real-world deployment and extensibility.

---

## üöÄ Project Overview

This application exemplifies:
- **End-to-end full stack development** with FastAPI (Python) and Vue 3 (TypeScript)
- **Enterprise-grade DevOps workflows** including CI/CD, Docker, and cloud deployment
- **Comprehensive security and monitoring** for production environments
- **Clean, maintainable code** and modern development practices

---

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

```
Frontend (Vue 3) ‚Üî Backend (FastAPI) ‚Üî Database (PostgreSQL)
                           ‚Üì
                    Monitoring Stack
                    (Prometheus + Grafana)
```

## ‚ö° Development Quick Start

### 1. Backend, Database, and Monitoring (Dev Mode)
Start all backend services, database, and monitoring stack using Docker Compose (dev configuration):

```bash
make dev
```
- This will launch the FastAPI backend, PostgreSQL database, Prometheus, and Grafana using `docker-compose.dev.yml`.

### 2. Frontend (Dev Mode)
The frontend is developed and run separately for optimal developer experience:

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```
- This starts the Vue 3 development server with hot reload at http://localhost:5173

### 3. Access Services
- **Frontend**: http://localhost:5173
- **Backend API**: http://localhost:8000
- **API Docs**: http://localhost:8000/docs
- **Grafana**: http://localhost:3001 (admin/admin)
- **Prometheus**: http://localhost:9090
